*1 15 50201 - Clock

*Converted by NeoDement
*the original did a bunch of stuff involving TMOD/TIME, but this one doesn't
*this one just moves the big hand round and when it reaches the top it moves the little hand

*(I was going to just put it in the file with the other overlays but figured if it had it's own classifier you could click it to turn off the annoying ticking sound)
