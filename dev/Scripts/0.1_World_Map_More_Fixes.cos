*some very rough and ready fixes/changes to the map by NeoDement


*Never mind! It turns out DELR is busted as hell and doesn't properly reset DOOR perms between deleted rooms and other rooms.
*Leaving these here as a guide of which rooms I think should be deleted when we do a proper pass on the map data though.

**TODO:!!!!! also delete the swamp
*
*
**deleted a lot of rooms that seemed to serve no purpose other than to confuse players when objects with the wrong perm fall into them
*
*
**the soil under the incubator room where norns often get stuck
