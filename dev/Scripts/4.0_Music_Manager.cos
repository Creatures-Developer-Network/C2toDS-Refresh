* 1 1 50201 - Music Manager

*Initial version by NeoDement. Overrides standard Near Death, Death and Birth music with Creatures 2 equivalents.
*Sometimes (rarely) the original Birth music plays instead of the override. This doesn't seem to happen with Death. No idea why.



*init this variable to the engine default in case something goes wrong and it tries to play it early.

*creature history event
*runs just before (or after?) the one included with DS and usually manages to hijack the event and play C2 music before the usual script tries to play its own uninterruptible music
